# GoCabby---RideHailing
GoCabby - Data Cleaning &amp; Transformation, EDA, Advanced Analysis &amp; insights.

Use Case Summary: Objective: The primary objective was to perform comprehensive data analysis on the "GoCabby" dataset, a collection of data related to a ride-hailing service. This analysis involved thorough data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and advanced SQL-based analytical queries to derive valuable insights about driver behavior, performance, and operational dynamics.

Data Overview: The "GoCabby" dataset initially contained various columns such as 'Driver ID', 'Online Minutes', 'Rides Presented', 'Rides Timeout', 'Rides Rejected', 'Rides Accepted', 'Driver City', 'Sign Up Date', along with several other metrics and rates. However, the dataset also included unnamed and irrelevant columns, indicating the need for data cleaning.

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Irrelevant Columns Removal: Dropped columns that were unnamed or contained meta-information not relevant to the analysis. Handling Missing Values: Identified and removed rows with missing 'Driver ID' as they were essential for our analyses. Data Type Corrections: Ensured proper data types, especially for dates and numerical values.

Exploratory Analysis: Summary Statistics: Calculated basic statistics (mean, min, max) for numeric columns like 'Online Minutes' and 'Rides Presented'. Unique Value Counts: Analyzed the distribution of categorical data like 'Driver City'. Date Range Analysis: Examined the range of 'Sign up Date' to understand the dataset's time frame.

Advanced Analysis: Driver Performance Analysis: Focused on individual driver metrics, calculating averages and sums of online minutes, rides presented/accepted/rejected, and rejection rates. City-wise Analysis: Explored operational differences across cities, looking at metrics like total drivers and average online minutes per city. Time Analysis: Investigated trends over time, such as changes in driver performance metrics across different years. Driver Engagement Analysis: Assessed the relationship between driver tenure and performance, categorizing drivers based on their tenure and comparing their average metrics. Ride Request Analysis: Analyzed the behavior of drivers in response to ride requests, focusing on averages of rides presented, accepted, rejected, and timeout. Peak Performance Analysis: Identified top-performing drivers based on acceptance rate, rejection rate, and online minutes. Hourly Ride Analysis: (Hypothetical) Assessed busiest hours for drivers by counting rides per hour, assuming timestamp data was available. Longevity Analysis: Correlated driver tenure with performance metrics. Demand-Supply Gap Analysis: Evaluated the gap between rides presented and accepted in different cities, indicating potential demand-supply issues. Rejection Reasons Analysis: (Hypothetical) Explored common reasons for ride rejections, assuming detailed rejection data was available.

Insights Driven: Driver Behavior: Insights into how different drivers perform and respond to ride requests, including variations in acceptance and rejection behaviors. Operational Insights: Understanding of city-wise operational differences and potential areas for improvement, such as addressing demand-supply gaps. Temporal Trends: Identification of trends over time, offering a view of how driver engagement and performance have evolved. Performance Benchmarking: Ability to identify top-performing drivers and understand the characteristics of high performance. Strategic Decision Making: The analysis provides a data-driven foundation for making strategic decisions to enhance operational efficiency and driver engagement. In summary, the comprehensive SQL-based analysis of the "GoCabby" dataset provided multi-dimensional insights into driver performance, operational efficiency, and customer engagement, which are crucial for strategic decision-making in the ride-hailing service domain.
